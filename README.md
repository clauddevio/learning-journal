# learning-journal by @clauddevio
Regular updates on projects can be found here. 
Short entries that show consistent progress. 

## How I use this journal
- **Frequency:** 3–5 short bullets after each coding session (or daily)
- **Format:** DD-MMM-YY, bullets focused on *outcomes* (what works, what broke, what I learned)
- **Links:** reference repos, issues, commits, PRs, and screenshots
